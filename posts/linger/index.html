For example, it stimulates the immune system. As they say, it serves motivation in life. You could even call it a reason for living. However, once overstimulation checks became routine, people have found their sense of stress numbed so heavily that we started to see patients who couldn&rsquo;t even recognise stimulation itself. Once that happens, they&rsquo;re like living corpses. Soon their autonomic nervous system stops functioning on its own and their vital functions shut down. Humans now care themselves to the point that they&rsquo;ve actually regressed as living beings. As much as our medical system has advanced, statistically the diagnosis of mental illness is actually increasing. This data will probably never be made public, though. Everything that could be considered a reason to live had died out. No one tries to talk seriously about what life should be like anymore.</p><p>Ouryou Rouichi, possessed a prodigious talent for drawing cruel, vivid nightmares using girls&rsquo; bodies as motifs. However, himself was a man of quite strict morality. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for there to be a disconnect between the creator and their impression their creators give. But in Rouichi&rsquo;s case, there was firm ideology there. According to him, by becoming firmly aware of the cruelty that hides in the dark depths of the human heart, humans can foster the common sense, ability to reason and goodwill to control that cruelty. He viewed his creative efforts as a means to englighten the populace. However, the spread of online recognition, ended this role that he had decided for himself. People don&rsquo;t have to control themselves anymore. Instead, they can now mainttain their mental health through machine assessments. Whatever the means, his ideal of humanity having healthy and sound minds had been realised. As a result, though, his mission ended and his life lost its meaning. With artists, concerned only with fame and wealth, he too probably had inner conflicts. In order to solve them, he used all kinds of state-of-the-art stress care methods. He was so dependent on them that you could call it addiction. Became a living corpse who couldn&rsquo;t get up in his own bed. It&rsquo;s as if Ouryou Rouichi was killed twice. First, his talent was killed by science and technology. And then, his soul was killed by society.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-folder meta-icon"><path d="M22 19a2 2 0 01-2 2H4a2 2 0 01-2-2V5a2 2 0 012-2h5l2 3h9a2 2 0 012 2z"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://zes1092.github.io/categories/thoughts/>thoughts</a></span></p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>389 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2022-05-16 00:00</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h></span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://zes1092.github.io/posts/fuckery/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
