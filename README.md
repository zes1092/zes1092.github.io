# ✔ Personal Website

> Personal portfolio website inspired by 'Hello Friend-Ng' Theme hosted by Hugo.

## Stack

- This website uses Hugo (a static site generator).

## Hosting

- The hosting is done on GitHub for free.

- In the pages section of the repo settings, it has been configured that the site is deployed from the `gh-pages` branch.

- On a push to the master branch, the GitHub action runs the workflow `github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`, which builds the website, and pushes the `public` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.
