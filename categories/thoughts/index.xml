No other generation has to pretend to know what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about. Today our entertainment is people&amp;rsquo;s lives. Where attention is literally a currency. I understand trying to take accountabiliy for your actions but everyone&amp;rsquo;s trying so hard to be on the right side of history that they sound like robots.</description></item><item><title>for her</title><link>https://zes1092.github.io/posts/for-her/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zes1092.github.io/posts/for-her/</guid><description>The dilemma for me was deciding when the stress of a relationship outweighs the love. How do you know when you&amp;rsquo;re just better off by yourself?
I learned the answer is success just has no time for emotions. People get on top of any industry by working algorithmically. But most likely you&amp;rsquo;re like me where horny and lonely is enough to pause your whole life. The reason I made this, is it forces me to reflect and be objective with my first relationship instead of being petty.</description></item></channel></rss>
