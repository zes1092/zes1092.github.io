I&amp;rsquo;ve heard some negative feedback on my ability to co-exist with whiny overdramatic females properly. What sticks out to me, is that they spend so much effort on looking good but their biggest issue with us is our creepy male gaze. She just wants to feel pretty and you&amp;rsquo;re telling her cheesy pickup lines from google. But it feels impossible to act normal around someone that&amp;rsquo;s literally carrying gold between their legs.</description></item><item><title>fifteen million merits</title><link>https://zes1092.github.io/posts/fifteen-million-merits/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zes1092.github.io/posts/fifteen-million-merits/</guid><description>I haven’t got a speech, I didn’t plan words, I didn’t even try to. I just knew that I had to get here, to stand here and I knew I wanted you to listen; to really listen, not just pull a face like you’re listening, like you do the rest of the time. A face like you’re feeling instead of processing. You pull a face and poke it towards the stage and la-di-da we sing and dance and tumble around and all you see up here, it’s not people, you don’t see people up here, it’s all fodder.</description></item><item><title>the stage is yours</title><link>https://zes1092.github.io/posts/the-stage-is-yours/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zes1092.github.io/posts/the-stage-is-yours/</guid><description>Social media has completely taken over our lives to the point where it&amp;rsquo;s a second reality.
It&amp;rsquo;s all a performance.
No other generation has to pretend to know what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about. Today our entertainment is people&amp;rsquo;s lives. Where attention is literally a currency. I understand trying to take accountabiliy for your actions but everyone&amp;rsquo;s trying so hard to be on the right side of history that they sound like robots.</description></item><item><title>All Pairs Shortest Paths, Rings and Semi Rings</title><link>https://zes1092.github.io/posts/all-pairs-shortest-paths-rings-and-semi-rings/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zes1092.github.io/posts/all-pairs-shortest-paths-rings-and-semi-rings/</guid><description>Introduction The Single Source Shortest Paths (SSSP) problem is to find the shortest distance from one node to every other node in a graph. The All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem, is to determine for every node in the graph, the shortest distance to every other node in a graph. APSP typically has applications in routing algorithms, i.e. finding the shortest path from one location to another.
Usual algorithms Depending on the type of graph, for both SSSP and APSP there are different algorithms to solve the relevant problems.</description></item><item><title>for her</title><link>https://zes1092.github.io/posts/for-her/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zes1092.github.io/posts/for-her/</guid><description>The dilemma for me was deciding when the stress of a relationship outweighs the love. How do you know when you&amp;rsquo;re just better off by yourself?
I learned the answer is success just has no time for emotions. People get on top of any industry by working algorithmically. But most likely you&amp;rsquo;re like me where horny and lonely is enough to pause your whole life. The reason I made this, is it forces me to reflect and be objective with my first relationship instead of being petty.</description></item></channel></rss>
