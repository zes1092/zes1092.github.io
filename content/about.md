Hi, I'm Ze Sheng and I'm studying Computer Science at the University of New South Wales. 

I like algorithms, backend development, some theoretical computer science. Some languages I like to program in are Python and Javascript. 

In my spare time, I like cats, fashion, art and music. 

```hs
-- my handcrafted website

data Person = Person {firstName :: String, lastName :: String}

main :: IO ()
main = let g = Person "ze" "sheng" in putStrLn $ "an" ++ firstName g
```
