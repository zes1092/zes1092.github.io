I'm turning 19 this summer. I'm at the age where you stop living in your own personal movie starring you. Reality is too much to pretend like everyone gets a happy ending. I've learned how **distraction is necessary** doing mindless activities like shopping and partying will keep you sane a little bit longer. 16 year old fake deep me would look at people in the mall like look at all these NPC. I looked down at people numbing themselves with plastic because they didn't realise how pointless it was. Now I'm like everyone knows we're all just trying to distract ourselves for a bit because life sucks and its draining. I used to be entitled thinking that I was unique for overthinking every situation all the time like life always had to be filled with act 3 movie scenes with dramatic realisations but you can't look for those moments. They just happen. A lot of what you learn as you age you can just be boiled down to conserving your energy. You're too tired. Now, you're old. It's just not worth the time anymore. You can't force relationships. If it causes any stress, it's wasting my time. Time is money. Money is fun. Fun is distraction. You see how it all connects. Ironically being more relaxed about what you want will make it happen. More meaning if you want a relationship. For me the best example was how much I used to try to force relationships with my first girlfriend. We were inevitably going to break up. I could not let go of her. I knew it but I felt like the protagonist. I needed a romantic interest at this point in the life movie. 


The brain is like a computer it needs something to do or else it's just gonna rot. Problems don't stop, they adjust. That's how it's gonna be for people like me. I bet you're the same with something to prove. Grown but time left on the clock. No matter how rich, famous, pretty, it's always going to be some problem. People can only retire and relax on a beach they're old because you don't have any other energy left. I'm at this weird point where if I reach a light amount of success doing what I love doing. I can kind of coast in this comfort zone. If I stop now and settle, I'm not a failure. But if I don't progress then I fall off which is worse than failing. This is such a good problem to have, but it's one of my hardest obstacles. At 19 you got to get of your head and look from a different perspective. You get older and see how selfish it is to ever think you're the main character. To ever think that your problems are the end of the world. You don't matter at this age. You can't hide behind the endearing youthfulness full of hope and possibility you're not cute anymore. You're turning 19, you're gonna be like this for a while.
