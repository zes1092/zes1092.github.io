> For most of human history, we lived in small, tight knit communities where everybody knew everything about everyone else. Being seen and understood wasnâ€™t an issue. Now we live in a world of strangers, where attention spans are short, and loneliness is endemic. Depth and complexity are liabilities: digestibility is key. You compress your personality into something which people can grasp in 10 seconds or less, before they get bored and swipe you away into oblivion. Something which they cannot ignore, even if it means making yourself into a human car wreck. Tiktok is the kabuki theatre of compressed personalities. People behave like caricatures of themselves, or who they wish to be. The proliferation of subcultures (alt-tiktok, emo-tiktok, cottagecore-tiktok) further flattens them into premade archetypes based around consumption patterns. You find the box which fits best, squeeze inside, and hope someone will love you. An act of self-dehumanization which provokes a natural response of cringe.
