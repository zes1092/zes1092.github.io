## pre nut 
I don't know how I'm supposed to view women like most men. I've heard some negative feedback on my ability to co-exist with whiny overdramatic females properly. What sticks out to me, is that they spend so much effort on looking good but their biggest issue with us is our creepy male gaze. She just wants to feel pretty and you're telling her cheesy pickup lines from google. It feels impossible to act normal around someone that's literally carrying gold between their legs. Even when she gets under your skin, what she got still feels worth it. You try to push away those feelings because when she realises your intention, she loses interest and kind of thinks you're pathetic. Your self-worth is dependent on her opinion and she starts resenting all the creepy jealous male anger that comes with it at some point. It's time to stop thinking like this. That's how the same woman who was pursued for her beauty ends up discarded and cut in half by some attractive guy. Maybe she can do more than spread her legs. Maybe if you look closer you'll see something you never noticed before. Maybe if you don't all the girls your age will have learned from their mistake and avoid some guy like you forever. But you also want to have the ability to sweep any girl off her feet, not in hopes that life is going to open the door for somebody better. Because you're insecure and women's admiration makes up for what you're lacking. It's selfish but you're tired of lifting women up on a pedestal only to doze off mid-conversation because you're talking to a girl who never had to develop a personality. Viewing women like romantic balls of joy is just as dumb as objectifying them because your heart will always get broken. Now, look at yourself. You're worried that if you keep viewing women as accessories for your life you will become a labeled incel. So it's time to go outside and meet real women platonic and celibate. I'm going to do all the research I can on how to untoxify myself and figure out the right way to view women.

Every girl has a different answer I don't even think they know what they want to be viewed. They want you to be straightforward but not too straightforward. But not too straightforward creep. They want your attention but only at the perfect moment when they need it. They kind of expect you to know how to read their minds. I'm starting to understand why a lot guys play it safe and stick to the hub. I'm talking like this issue is universal. I attach so much importance to women's attention because I grew up not knowing how to socialise. When you can't get something, you start believing you won't be happy until you do. Your value as a man shouldn't depend on a woman. She simply wants somebody that doesn't need her instead. Instead of approaching women as a projection of your desires. It's better to see them as just other people. Usually, people are more interesting than they seem.

### clarity 
> I'm not an incel. I'm not this toxic person that I display here. Well I used to be. Very obviously put on in the beginning so that I can debunk an argument at the end. The misogyny that I'm trying to debunk is the whole part was trying to come off like a misogynist person. I'm taking a perspective of a neurotic and angst man who doesn't know how to communicate. Knowing so many men who are like this, there's a bit of irony that I'm trying to convey a nuanced perspective to be truthful. If you want to say something controversial and telling and say what you really feel, you're going to risk having people canceling you. That is called growth.
