The dilemma for me was deciding when the stress of a relationship outweighs the love. How do you know when you're just better off by yourself. I learned the answer is success just has no time for emotions. People get on top of any industry by working algorithmically. But most likely you're like me where horny and lonely is enough to pause your whole life. The reason I made this is it forces me to reflect and be objective with my first relationship instead of being petty. What I really want to do is villianise her in my head and fixate on all the bad things but the reality is, I was closer with her than I was with any other human in that time period. I travelled with her, pillow talked every night, matured and learned about each other. Now we don't even speak. I know our experiences will stay with me forever and that's the part I should remember. My chapter with her is now over and it was a good one.
