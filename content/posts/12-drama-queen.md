> In the end, you're just a drama queen. You're doing this for the attention. Right now, you just want someone to tell you, "You're not horrible!". It's only natural that someone like you isn't treated nicely. You wanted to be like her. Acknowledged, relied upon, and depended upon, just like her. That's why you jumped at the change to snag the title of her status. You wanted to watch someone else to do the work and boss them around to feel superior. That's what you called "personal growth." I bet everyone already realised it. Look at me. I don't know shit about you, yet I figured it out. Think about it. I don't give a damn about you, but I found you first. Logically, that means no one was really looking for you, were they? You get it now, don't you? That's all you're worth to them. Nothing.
