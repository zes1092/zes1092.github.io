We are animals. No homo homosapiens. Monkeys with smartphones obsessed with power. It's eye-opening seeing all the Jesus in Italy because of the stark reminder of where Jesus even comes from. 
Italy is one of the European countries that holds on to its traditions with nostalgia beause those were its glory years. Back when sophistication led to exploration and meant the end of our animal lives. The natives didn't have one God with a beard. They danced for the the sun and drummed for the rain. They didn't have guns and governments. They had little dick skirts and spears. They sacrificed human heads for fun and raided other villages. Basically live like monkeys with language and spirituality. The truth is that power corrupted our animal way of life in the name of progression. But is it really better. We iron our shirts and sexualise ourselves but does that really mean that we're more evolved than an ape. The truth is hard to digest so most people avoid its complementation until death. The truth will make sane people insane. The truth causes chaos. Tom Waits famously said 

> Reality is for people that can't face drugs.
