> The people who are dependent on the system will fight and defend the system 

The whole idea of law and order is a constructed lie. All it is, is about if you are high enough of this ladder. Law is just a purposefully ambiguous and confusing language just for higher powers. They benefit by exercising their power just to enslave the lower filfth. As Orwellian beautifully hypothesised "War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength". Numbed to our core, distracted with first world problems that we may as well believe "2 + 2 = 5". 

Corruption exists everywhere but operates on a different level in the western world. Nothing left besides money and corporate agenda. Where there is no moral fiber beyond the dollar. I find it offensive that corruption is not accessible for everybody. If certain higher identities can play the game, let us all play. 

To ever believe that the government is the guardian of democracy is impossible. Yet, governments still fail to do the principal baseline. The NSW Premier, Gladys is by far the personification of the unseen monolith cunt by enforcing compulsory mandates such as lockdowns and vaccinations breaking their own constructed laws of democracy. Gladys now pulls a clueless face on what has happened. Leads a whole generation into further recession. Refuses to elaborate. Gets strangled by her own set of orders. All for what. Just to comply with pointless health guidelines. All because 98% of Covid-19 deaths were because of people with a low health immune system or had some serious underlying health condition. 

> If I do reach that status of higher power, I will reap all of the benefits of corruption. At that point, I will blindly rip an eye out for the government. I will fuck the government.
