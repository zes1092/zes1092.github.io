> This is essentially a confession. That or a lover's quarrel, or maybe a break up. Having to listen to it right next to them, I felt like an idiot. It felt like being forced to realise just how irrelevant I am. It kind of annoyed me. It would make anyone want to hurl a little insult like, "That's creepy." Honestly, I really want him to take responsibility. Seriously, I never imagined their talk would get this complicatedd while somehow being so clear and precise. And if he fed that line to me with such a serious face, I don't know what I'd do. For reals, I want him to take responsiblity. He's never done that once so far. But still, I don't want him to take just say "It's my responsibility" like it's some frivolous excuse.
