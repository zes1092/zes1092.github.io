Social media has completely taken over our lives to the point where it's a second reality. 

> It's all a performance. 

No other generation has to pretend to know what they're talking about. Today our entertainment is people's lives. Where attention is literally a currency. I understand trying to take accountabiliy for your actions but everyone's trying so hard to be on the right side of history that they sound like robots. Deciding what is right from wrong. They only do it to appear morally superior to people online. 



I've realised being away from people how much I missed it. When you speak to someone face to face, suddenly all that noise you forget about when you're in the real world talking to real people. People drop their act when you talk to them face to face. I've realised how much I say in conversations not because it's truthful or it's funny but because how people are going to perceive me if I tell them. We want to seem special. We want to be cooler than we really are. But you'll notice as soon as you say something embarassing. As soon as you actually open up to someone. Their guard goes away. Now they're not performing. You can speak to them like they really are. When in reality, I'm guilty of all the stuff I'm criticising. I'm completely addicted to social media. And I care too much what people think about me.
